 I will post here  some stochastic simulations I have been running, with an ultimate goal of sharing some ideas and codes on Simulated Annealing. A few remarks before we start:

- I don't claim originality for the results posted here: these are mostly some quick experiments I did while doing research. 
- I jump back and forth between  programming languages and softwares: some codes are in python, some are in R, some are in Matlab and, whenever symbolic computation is necessary, I use Sage. Even if you don't know any of the sintax used in one of these languages, it is very simple to read these codes and start coding your own things :) 

## Some notes and codes

- [An example of the rejection method](Rejection_method.html) ([pdf version](Rejection_method.pdf))
- [A quick example of simulated annealing](Simulated annealing/Simulated annealing.html) ([pdf version](Simulated annealing/Simulated annealing.pdf)) 
- [A quick comparison between the previous result using simulated annealing and gradient descent]() ([pdf version](Gradient Descent/gradient_descent.pdf)) 

For the following, it is helpful if, besides python,  you know a little bit of tensorflow (the code is "almost self explanatory", but it is always helpful if you have been previously exposed to tensorflow's idea)

([jupyter-notebook version](Weight_evolution_shallow_NN/Weight_evolution_in_shallow_NN.ipyb))

The next notebook is a continuation of the previous one. Instead of using classical backpropagation, we use a probabilistic way to choose new weights
